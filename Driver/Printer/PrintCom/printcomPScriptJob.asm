COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		AppendToProlog
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Write out the printer-specific prolog

CALLED BY:	INTERNAL
		PrintStartJob

PASS:		bp	- pstate segment
		di	- file handle to write to

RETURN:		carry	- set if some error

DESTROYED:	nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		get a pointer into the device info table, and write out
		some additional prolog, if needed.

		additionally, check for a file called "pscript.pat" in the
		system directory and copy it at this time as well.

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
		none
